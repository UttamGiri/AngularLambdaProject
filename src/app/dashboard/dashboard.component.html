    <h4> QUESTION AND ANSWER</h4>

    <ol>
      <li> API Gateway and DynamoDB. Nirav found that candidates have used AWS before but for different use cases â€“
        DevOps (deploying services on AWS),
        classic development (S3, EC2, SNS, SQS etc.), whereas, we are looking for experience with other set of AWS
        services?
      </li>
      <li class="skip" style="margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Answer:</b> I have experience of working on
        monolothic project In fact this angular app is deployed on AWS s3 bucket.
        I have built microservices projet using sprint boot deployed in EC2 intance also. This backend project is built
        on Serverless architecture using java. AWS LAMBDA, COGNITO, DYNAMO DB, ELASTIC SEARCH SERVICE.
        All are server less no need for maintaining clusters , all manged by AWS Guys. </li>
      <li class="skip">Microservices project can be found in
        https://github.com/UttamGiri/microservice-aws-link/blob/master/readme-prod-run.txt

        serverless cloud AWS environment) ?
      </li>
      <li class="skip" style="margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:10px;"><b>Answer:</b> Speaking truth, till now i haven't got
        a chance to work 100% serverless,
        that is why i built this project to prove that i have a knowledge of it.
      </li>
